# AdventOfCode2021

Solutions to the 2021's https://adventofcode.com/ puzzles.

I did days 1 and 2 in LibreOffice Calc, so there are no solutions included for these. All others are implemented in C++ (C++17 in some places) and include project and solution files for Visual Studio 2019, but should run with any other compiler or platform.

All solutions are left in the "just working" state, where I got the answers to the puzzles. No tidy-up, commenting, refactoring or feature enhancement was done. You have been warned...
